Just think if we can easily harness the power of Nexmo with just a few lines of code, imagine what companies could do to make an impact on their customers in a sexy way.   Okay that's all I have for you..  Ta  Ta..  Yes I'm British..  We say Ta Ta...  We also say shedule...  Oh and I want to thank Mr. Parone for the Jimmy John's sub that you just ordered today.  It was just delivered to me here in San Francisco...  Yes, I did..   Ha Ha... Sorry couldn't resist,   Have a great day everybody!!"
