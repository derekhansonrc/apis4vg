If Derek can make me sing and dance, with a couple lines of code , imagine what our customer could do to get people's attention.   Just think of the use cases.   We could even do a reverse IVR call.  Let's just imagine for a second that I'm not just actually just Brian, but I'm Brian the sophisticated IVR..   Beep...Beep..Beep   Good chatting with you.   Press 1 if you would like to talk with a customer service associate or just stay on the line while I mock you on mute...  Oh and Mr. Parone thanks for the Jimmy John's sub that you ordered for yourself today.  It was just delivered to me in San Francisco...  Ha Ha... Sorry couldn't resist."
