If Derek can make me sing and dance with a couple lines of code , imagine what our customer could do to get people's attention.   So many user cases.   It could be an annouuncement for a school closing, a sales campaign, or we could even do a reverse IVR call.  Let's just imagine for a second that I'm not just Brian, but I'm Brian the IVR..   Beep...Beep..    Just play along... ..  Hello, you have reached ABC Company..  Press 1 for customer service..  Press 2 to put in your number..   Okay, please press or say your account number.   Come on.. you can do it...   Why are you delaying?  Why is this taking so long!!   No take your time...   Okay.. that's it...  For God's sakes lady give me your damn number!!  Ha ha...    Anybody get the reference?   Okay moving on...   All I'm saying is don't underestimate the power that this flexible yet easy to program text to speech engine delivers to our customers..   okay that is all i wanted to say.   Good chatting with you.   Oh and Perrone thanks for the Jimmy John's sub that you ordered for yourself today.  It was just delivered to me in San Francisco...  Ha Ha... Sorry couldn't resist."
