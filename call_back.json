And think if we can easily harness the power of Nexmo with just a few lines of code, imagine what companies could do to make an impact on their customers by reaching out to them in a very innovative manner..   Okay that's all I have for you..  Ta  Ta..  Yes I'm British..  We say Ta Ta...  We also say shedule...  Oh and Mr. Parone thanks for the Jimmy John's sub that you ordered for yourself today.  It was just delivered to me here in San Francisco...  Ha Ha... Sorry couldn't resist,   Have a great day everybody!!"
