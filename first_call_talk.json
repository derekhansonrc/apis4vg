Franco wanted me to call and give you some advice on how to respond to a customer wanting discounts... This is what you tell them...   I don't have any discounts, but what I do have are a very particular set of epid sales skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career of wine dropping and doing demos. Skills that make me a nightmare for my competitors. If you agree to go forward with Vonage now that'll be the end of it. I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will take you to top golf, pay for your dinner and drinks and above all else...  I will freaking close you...  Oh and by the way Team 5280...  Good Morning!!  In case you couldn't guesss...  You are listening to a text-to-speech Call made with the Nexmo Voice API"
