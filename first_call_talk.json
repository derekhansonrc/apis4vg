Franco wanted me to call and give you some advice on how to respond to customers demanding discounts... This is what you tell them...   I don't have any discounts, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills,  Skills I have acquired over a very long career of wine dropping and cold calling, Skills that make my competitors like Ring Central and Jive have nightmares, Now If you agree to go forward with Vonage business right now, then that, will be the end of it!!! I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you,   ..I will find you.. and when I do, I will take you to top golf, pay for your dinner and drinks and above all else, I will, effin, close, you!!  Ha Ha...  Oh and by the way, In case you couldn't guess, You are listening to a text-to-speech Call made with the Nexmo Voice API.  Have a nice day!"
